### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anastasia and im part of **Black codhers bootcamp**. I recently just graduated from my bachelors degree in biochemistry and looking to get involved into the tech world. My parents are originally from Nigerian but i was born in italy and so i can speak italian fluently.
Im interested in learning how to code websites, so essentially becoming a software engineer at the end of this bootcamp which involves becoming a full stack developer.
Right now im working on how to use Github, what commands to use to make new directoriess and files in the directories and commands for git.
My hubbies currently are to binge watch shows on netflix, my favourite shows curretly are squid game, You and money heist.
